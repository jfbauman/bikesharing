# Bikesharing
NYC Citi Bike - Tableau

## Overview of the analysis

Last summer my friend Kate and I took a trip to NYC. To our surprise, one of our favorite parts was Citi Bike because it allowed us to get around the city easily and interact with the others. The idea was born to start a similiar bikeshare business in Des Moines, Iowa, and so the brainstorming began. We analyzed City Bike data and created effective visualizations to present to potential investors.
