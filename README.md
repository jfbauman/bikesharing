NYC Citi Bike - Tableau

## Overview of the analysis

My friend Kate and I took a trip to NYC last summer. To our suprise, one of our favorite parts was Citi Bike because it allowed us to get around the city easily and interact with the others. The brainstorming began to see if we could start a similiar bikeshare business in Des Moines, Iowa. We analyzed City Bike data and created effective visualizations to present to investors who may proved seed funding.
